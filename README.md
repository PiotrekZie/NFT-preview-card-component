## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I learned (although I don't fully understand yet) how positioning works in flex. Additionally, it took me the most time to sort out the issue regarding the hover in the image (I still see the problem with the opacity img hover). The rest seemed understandable by the previous challenge I made.

```css
.overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    opacity: 0;
}
.picbg:hover .overlay {
    opacity: 0.5;
    background: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
.viewicon {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I definitely want to focus on learning exactly how to create components according to imposed rules. Everything always comes back in my head to the fact that somewhere someone invented some rule of creating websites and I create as it seems to me (the effect can be seen in the project)

### Useful resources

- [Aligning Items in a Flex Container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - As I mentioned earlier on MDN you can very quickly find out about any element you are interested in when creating a page.
- [CSS @media Rule](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand media query. I recommend it to anyone who is still learning this concept.
